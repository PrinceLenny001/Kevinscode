#Detailed story points for building a Rockwell .ACD file editor
below is a numbered list of tasks. Each task is divided into substeps (Using checkboxes) with explicit details on what to build, what sample data to use, and which storybook story states to create. all tasks assume usage of next.js (App Router), react functional components, typescript with strict mode and tailwind css for styling. all ui elements should be build with Tailwind and then intergrated into higher-level components.

## Rockwell .ACD File Editor - Story Point Breakdown for AI Coding Agent

This document outlines the story points and tasks for developing a Rockwell .ACD file editor application, similar to Studio 5000, broken down into 1-story-point increments suitable for an AI coding agent.  Each story point focuses on a small, testable unit of work.

**I. Project Setup and Core Libraries (5 Story Points)**

1. **Story: Set up the project environment and dependencies.**
    *   [x] Initialize a new project (e.g., using React, Angular, or Vue.js for frontend, Node.js/Python for backend).
    *   [x] Install necessary libraries for file handling, UI components, and potential .ACD parsing (if available).  Consider using a placeholder or mock library initially if a real parser isn't immediately available.  Document chosen libraries and rationale.  Example: `npm install react react-dom @mui/material` (React example).
    *   [x] Set up basic project structure (components, services, API endpoints).
    *   [x] Configure version control (Git).

2. **Story: Implement basic file upload functionality.**
    *   [x] Create a file upload component in the UI.  Storybook: `FileUpload` component, state: `initial`, `loading`, `uploaded`, `error`.
    *   [x] Implement backend API endpoint to handle file uploads.  Accept `.acd` files. Validate file extension.
    *   [x] Store uploaded file temporarily (e.g., in memory or temporary storage).
    *   [x] Display file name after successful upload.

3. **Story: Develop a mock .ACD file parser (initial placeholder).**
    *   [x] Create a mock parser that simulates reading .ACD file structure.  This will be replaced later.
    *   [x] Define a JSON representation of the .ACD file data (programs, routines, tags, etc.).  Start simple, e.g., just program names. Example: `{"programs": [{"name": "MainProgram"}, {"name": "SubRoutine1"}]}`.
    *   [x] Implement the mock parser to return this JSON structure when given a file.

4. **Story: Display program names from the parsed .ACD file.**
    *   [x] Create a component to display a list of program names. Storybook: `ProgramList` component, state: `loading`, `loaded` (with program names), `error`.
    *   [x] Integrate the mock parser and display the program names in the list.

5. **Story: Implement a basic text editor component.**
    *   [x] Integrate a text editor component (e.g., CodeMirror, Ace Editor) for displaying and editing ladder logic. Storybook: `LadderLogicEditor` component, state: `initial`, `editing`, `saved`.
    *   [x] Configure the editor for basic text editing.


**II. .ACD File Parsing and Data Model (10 Story Points)**

6. **Story: Research and select a suitable .ACD file parsing strategy.**
    *   [x] Investigate existing libraries or tools for parsing .ACD files.  Document findings.
    *   [x] If no suitable library exists, define a strategy for parsing the binary .ACD format. This may involve reverse engineering.  Outline the approach.

7. **Story: Implement the .ACD file parser (Phase 1 - Program and Routine Names).**
    *   [x] Implement the parser to extract program and routine names from the .ACD file.
    *   [x] Update the data model to include routines within each program. Example: `{"programs": [{"name": "MainProgram", "routines": ["Routine1", "Routine2"]}, {"name": "SubRoutine1", "routines": ["SubRoutine1_Routine1"]}]}`.
    *   [x] Update the `ProgramList` component to display routines within each program.

8. **Story: Implement .ACD file parser (Phase 2 - Tags).**
    *   [x] Extend the parser to extract tag information (name, type, scope).
    *   [x] Update the data model to include tags within routines. Example: `{"programs": [...], "tags": [{"name": "Motor1_Start", "type": "BOOL", "scope": "Local"}]}`.

9. **Story: Implement .ACD file parser (Phase 3 - Ladder Logic).**
    *   [ ] Implement the parser to extract ladder logic instructions (rungs, elements, etc.). This might be the most complex part. Focus on a subset of instructions initially.
    *   [ ] Update the data model to represent the ladder logic structure.  This may involve a nested structure.

10. **Story:  Integrate parsed ladder logic into the editor.**
    *   [ ] Display the parsed ladder logic in the text editor component.  This may require custom rendering logic.  Start with a simple text-based representation.
    *   [ ] Update the `LadderLogicEditor` Storybook state to include the ladder logic data.

11. **Story: Implement basic ladder logic syntax highlighting in the editor.**
    *   [ ] Add syntax highlighting to the editor to differentiate between instructions, tags, etc.

12. **Story: Implement tag browsing/search functionality.**
    *   [ ] Create a component to display a list of tags.
    *   [ ] Implement search/filtering functionality for tags.

13. **Story: Implement basic ladder logic editing (text-based).**
    *   [ ] Allow users to edit the ladder logic in the text editor.
    *   [ ] Implement basic validation of the edited ladder logic.

14. **Story: Implement saving changes back to the .ACD file (Phase 1 - JSON representation).**
    *   [ ] Implement functionality to save the edited ladder logic back to the JSON representation of the .ACD file.

15. **Story: Research .ACD file writing methods.**
    *   [ ] Investigate methods for writing back to the .ACD file format.  This might be as complex as the parsing.  Document findings.

**III. Advanced Features and UI Enhancements (10+ Story Points)**

16. **Story: Implement more advanced ladder logic editing features (e.g., drag-and-drop, graphical editing).**
    *   [ ]  (Multiple story points) Break down this into smaller tasks, like implementing drag-and-drop for specific ladder elements.

17. **Story: Implement tag management features (e.g., adding, deleting, renaming tags).**
    *   [ ] (Multiple story points) Break down into smaller tasks.

18. **Story: Implement cross-referencing and search functionality for tags and routines.**

19. **Story: Implement compare/diff functionality between different versions of .ACD files.**

20. **Story:  Implement online/offline mode.**

21. **Story: Improve UI/UX (e.g., better layout, user interactions, error handling).**
    *   [ ] (Multiple story points) Break down into smaller UI/UX tasks.  Storybook states should be defined for all UI components.

22. **Story: Implement robust error handling and user feedback.**

23. **Story: Implement testing (unit tests, integration tests).**
    *   [ ] (Multiple story points) Write tests for each component and API endpoint.

24. **Story: Implement documentation (API documentation, user documentation).**

25. **Story: Packaging and deployment of the application.**
